# Whale_off_port(folio) project


In this project we need to create a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across multiple areas such volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios, and determine which portfolio is performing the best across these areas.


We were given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 

Using the analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P TSX 60 Index).

For this homework assignment, the three main tasks include:
-Read in and Wrangle Returns Data
-Determine Success of Each Portfolio
-Choose and Evaluate a Custom Portfolio

## Risk Analysis ##
Based on the first Standard Deviation graph, and calculations

### STD data of portfolios

We can determine that all portfolios with the exception of Palson & Co. Inc. have a greater standard deviation, and are of greater risk than the S&P TSX 60

## Sharpe Ratios ##

SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC      0.286709

PAULSON & CO.INC.             -0.547594

TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC   -0.144455

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC         0.467045

Algo 1                         1.491514

Algo 2                         0.396817

tsx return                     0.195550

By analyzing the first sharpe ratios output, and bar graph we can see that the Algorithmic 1 strategy outperformed both the market S&P TSX and the all of the whales portfolios significantly.

Algorithmic strategy 2 although did very well by outperforming the S&P TSX, and most of the whales portfolios with the exception of the Berkshire Hathaway INC. portfolio.

## Custom Portfolio analysis ##
The Custom portfolio does well and outperforms all of the Whales portfolios.  However Algorithmic strategy 1 still does the best of all strategies.  Which should indicate soemthing about algorithmic strategies in finance and the future of these kind of techniques in the market.
